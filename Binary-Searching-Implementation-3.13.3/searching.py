Binary search is alot efficient method of searching a 
target value in comparison to Linear search

The time complexity of binary search is O(log n) 
because the time it takes to search through the list 
grows logarithmically with the size of the list.

The space complexity of binary search is O(1) 
because it doesn't require any additional space 
to search through the list.
